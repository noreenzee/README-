# Summary Of Report: This report is summarizing the statistical modeling and written analysis results of "Kickstarter-Challenge" assigned for weekly challenge activity.
The purpose of this report is to document sampling design and the techniques used to get these results.
## Sampling Protocol: sampling protocol for given report and the final sampling techniques are discussed in section two of this report. Adding extra columns and sheets are done to get final statistical results, after adding columns and sheet in the given data set final tables and charts are created to provide accurate results for "Data" provided.
### Filters: Filters are used on the "Kickstarter-Challenge" sheet to create new columns for required findings like in order to finds results for "Plays", "Catagory and Subcatagory Coulumn" is filtered. To generate a "Date", Date conversion function is used and again for creating chart a year column is generated on the main Kickstarter sheet. These changes can be viewed on following link: https://1drv.ms/x/s!Arl4JQEmJujJjDLmrRRRf1nu0mmb?e=qipu0L
#### Theater Outcomes by Launced Date: In order to get "Theater Outcomes Based On Launched Date", Outcome column is filtered to calculate the outcomes just for theater and new sheet is created to make a pivot table and chart for "Theater Outcomes". The "Pivot Table" is filtered on the based of Parent catagory and Years. Compaign outcomes for theater are sorted in decending order so successful outcomes comes at first, failed on second and canceled at last. Line chart is created for pivot table.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112978144/200707768-7b87fc24-e410-4339-bf86-23e10453d2d3.png).!
 ##### PNG Link: Chart created for the Pivot Table is save as PNG picture that can be access on: [Theater outcomes vs launch png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112978144/200712666-a963679b-1f67-4fcb-b657-c208fde288de.png)

###### "Outcomes Based on Goals" are created on seperate sheet and valuses are created for pass, failed and canceled outcomes along with the percentages for pass, failed and canceled outcomes. There was a specific goal range to calculate the all pass, failed and canceled outcomes and to do so "countif and countifs" functions are used.
#######  Conclusion: Finally all data is pused on git repository for review from the instructor.
# Analysis:  ## Summary Statement: This report is created to provide the overall statistical analysis of the "Kickstarter Challenge" for weekly challenge activity to  "UOU BootCamp Instructor" to review. All techniques and stratagies used to get final statistics are included in the report along with detailed steps that are taken.This Dataset was provided for the analysis to find outcomes based on goals and "Theater Outcomes" based on Launched Date and to do so first, there was a need to add some more columns like "Subcatagory" column is created and filtered to count outcomes for "Plays" only. 'Date and Year" column is created for "Pivot Table" and "Lnine Chart". Pivot Table is filtered by parent catagory and years and values are set in column and row format.
### A sheet is added to the main workbook to find Theater Outcomes Based On Launced Date to find pass, failed and canceled outcomes. Passed and Failed Outcomes have low and high values but there aren't any canceled outcomes, Outcomes for Theater based on Launced Date was presented in the following table and chart that shows that there is a big spike in successful outcomes as compare to other outcomes, screenshot for these outcomes can be access here:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112978144/200717809-3a375181-034d-43e2-81cd-3c1bcf306fd0.png)
#### Outcomes Based On Goal sheet was added to find pass, failed and canceled outcomes for "Plays" only based on the set range of goals using "countifs" function and then we cameup with percentage for all theree pass, failed, and canceled outcome and created a chart to based on percentages and find that there is a noticeable spike in the failed outcomes that represented by Orange color line and pass outcomes are more likely in between medium and lower range. Here is a screenshot that represent this data:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112978144/200720597-58617b3b-657b-4550-bff7-39452e66461b.png)
##### Conclusion: Data shows that there is significant difference in both outcomes Theater is more successful than plays.
There were some points were it look like its hard to properly used "countifs function" and "github" but with some effort I came up with this work and waiting for my instructor comments to improve.
